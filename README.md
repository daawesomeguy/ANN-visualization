We often see neural networks represented with nodes and lines between the nodes. But what does this mean?

Neural networks, like any machine learning model, are actually a function with an input in an output. 

All of the nodes actually represent a function with many constants. When training, the neural network adjusts these constants to approximate a complicated function.

This program simulates a small neural network approximating the sin x function and we can see the model learning solely by adjusting these little parameters.
